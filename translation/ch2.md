# Chapter 2: The Crude Birth of a Genre

Synopsis: In order to understand dota, you must first look at the circumstance of dota. You must look at the evolution of the genre within the Blizzard Entertainment real-time strategy ecosystem, through the third-party content creation for Warcraft II, StarCraft, and Warcraft III. In giving this matter extended scrutiny, you will find that the dota genre was not the matter of design genius, but of circumstance and impediment. Unlike the commercial game designers who have the talent and resources to shape the game experience, every Blizzard game offered a new set of restrictions for amateur content creators. Bound by these limitations, content creators used RTS game engines and RTS map editors to build a character-action game. You will find that these limitations—and the flaws that came with those limitations—have shaped the mechanical, aesthetic, philosophical, and economic conventions of its genre. This book will highlight those limitations as it is necessary to do so.

梗概：为了更好的理解 dota 游戏，你必须先了解 dota 的现状。你必须先看一下 dota 作为魔兽争霸II、星际争霸和魔兽争霸III 的在暴雪娱乐实时战略生态系统内，经过第三方内容创造的演变。仔细审视这个演变，你会发现， dota 类型不是设计天才的问题，而是情况和障碍的问题。与那些塑造游戏体验，拥有天赋和资源的商业游戏设计师不同，每个暴雪游戏都为业余内容创作者提供了一套新的限制。这些限制下，内容创作者使用 RTS 游戏引擎和 RTS 地图编辑器来建立一个角色动作游戏。你会发现，这些限制，以及由此而带来的缺陷，塑造了 dota 的游戏机制、美学、哲学以及经济习俗。这本书将凸显那些有必要的限制。

We should now discuss the rise of Defense of the Ancients as it emerged from the Blizzard Entertainment real-time strategy ecosystem. Now, why is that? While videogames are collaborative works that showcase the creativity of highly talented individuals, I believe that the history of videogames has been largely written by economics and circumstance. Videogames are art, but it's a business of art. The great videogame designers have found the means to mold the business of videogames to their own interests and talents, whether they're catering to the demands of the corporate board, working with others at an independent game developer, or creating free content for a commercial game engine in their spare time. This does not mean you cannot learn games through the simple act of playing them, but circumstance is a valuable tool for confirming your instincts, and the circumstance of dota is no exception.

我们现在应该讨论 DotA 自暴雪娱乐实时战略生态系统中出现后的崛起。为何现在讨论这个？虽然电子游戏是展示才华横溢的个人的创造性合作的作品，但我相信电子游戏的历史在很大程度上已经被经济和环境改写。电子游戏是艺术，但它是一门商业的艺术。伟大的电子游戏设计师，为他们自己的兴趣和天赋，已经找到了塑造电子游戏商业的方法，无论他们是否满足公司董事会的需求，他们会在业余时间和独立游戏开发者一同工作，或是为商业化游戏引擎创造免费的内容。这并不意味着，你不能通过玩游戏这种简单的行为来学习游戏，而是证明你的本能的一种手段的情形，并且 dota 也不例外。

A couple of unrelated events would usher in the popularity of third-party content for use with Blizzard software. Many games featuring elements we associate with RTS would find reverence and acclaim from their contemporary audiences.^1 But with 1992's Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty, Westwood Studios would codify the archetype for the RTS genre—build a base, build an army, destroy the other base—that is now commonly thought of as RTS.[^2]() The following year, id Software would release Doom, and with help from the continuing and emerging adoption of the internet, the game would launch a voracious consumer appetite for player-created content. People wanted to make their own maps, and by using the internet, they could get complete strangers to play and enjoy them. In November of 1994, Blizzard Entertainment would launch their own RTS flavor with Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, setting the stage for what was to come.

几个不相关的事件，与暴雪软件一起使用，会在第三方使用的内容中引起流行。许多以 RTS 为特色的游戏，都会受到同时代玩家的尊敬和称赞。[^1]() 但是 1992 年的沙丘 II：王朝的建筑，西木工作室定义了 RTS 类型的原型，建立一个基地，建立一个军队，摧毁其他基地，现在通常被认为是 RTS。[^2]() 第二年，id 软件公司发布毁灭，并在互联网持续且新兴采用的帮助下，游戏会调动起狂热的消费对游戏玩家创作的内容的欲望。

While turn-based strategy games had already allowed players to customize, randomize, and create their own battlefields, it seemed fairly inevitable that RTS would use "Create your own maps!" as a selling point. And when Blizzard released their 1995 RTS classic Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, they would provide players a functional, intuitive map editor. The nicest thing to be said about the editor is that it provided the user-friendly approach that would come to define the later editors for Blizzard RTS games. But when we compare it with the tools used to create content for today's games, it was largely deficient. Players were given no access to the mission briefing system, the maps could not be linked together as part of a campaign, and those maps could not feature victory conditions beyond "kill everything". In-effect, maps existed as individual entities within their own contained ecosystem and had little flavor beyond the arrangement of the units and terrain.

在回合制策略游戏已经允许玩家进行自定义、随机创建他们自己的战场的情况下，似乎 RTS 游戏不可避免地使用“创建自己的地图！”作为卖点。当 1995 年暴雪发布他们 RTS 的经典魔兽争霸II：黑暗的潮流时，他们为玩家提供了一款实用、直观的地图编辑器。对于地图编辑器最好的事情是，为暴雪 RTS 游戏定义后面的地图编辑器提供了用户友好的方式。但是，当我们将它与用于为今天的游戏创建内容的工具进行比较时，这在很大程度上是不足的。玩家们没有获得访问任务的简洁系统，地图不能作为一场战役的一部分链接在一起，并且那些地图除了“杀死一切敌人”以外不能表征胜利的状况。实际上，地图作为独立的实体存在于它们自己包含的生态系统内，并且除了安排单位和地带以外并没有什么特色。

Third-party programs such as War2xEd and PUDDraft would give players more control over the design of their maps—allowing players to make rudimentary customizations for units and AI—and Wardraft would even allow players to customize and modify the game files. (In spite of this, "total conversions" would never catch on.[^3]()) Warcraft II ultimately lacked support for the scripting or programming that would allow units and buildings to act outside of their parameters.[^4]() For example, a scenario where friendly knights run towards your base to "warn you of the impending danger" was simply impossible.[^5]() These limitations would stifle the growth of what we now think of as "custom maps", the maps which attempted to take Blizzard RTS games in unconventional directions.[^6]() Puzzle maps and so-called "Olympic" maps usually asked the player to take a small number of units and get them to a destination on the map. But for the most part, these maps were simply exaggerations of the Warcraft II mechanics, instead of anything that players would consider its own "game". Skirmish and singleplayer maps would dominate the landscape for content creation in Warcraft II, and the custom map would remain an unknown quantity.

第三方程序，如 War2xEd 和 PUDDraft 将给玩家更多他们地图的设计的控制 - 允许玩家做基本的定制单位和 AI 和 Wardraft 甚至允许玩家自定义和修改游戏文件。（尽管如此，“总转化次数”永远不会停止。[^3]()）魔兽争霸II 对于那些会允许超出他们参数的单元和建筑的脚本或程序起作用，缺少根本上的支持。[^4]() 例如，这样一个场景，一名友好的骑士跑向你的基地，警告你“即将到来的危险”是根本不可能的。[^5]() 这些限制会抑制我们现在所认为的“自定义地图”的地图的发展，而这些地图试图以非常规的方向进行暴雪 RTS 游戏。[^6]() 拼图和所谓的“奥林匹克”地图通常要求玩家采取少量的单元，并令他们到地图上的目的地。但在很大程度上，这些地图只是夸大了魔兽争霸II机制，而不是玩家认为的自己的“游戏”。对于魔兽争霸II内容的创作，战斗地图和单人地图站了风景的主要部分，而自定义地图数量未知。

Blizzard would provide the leap forward when they released their Campaign Editor alongside StarCraft in 1998. The new scripting techniques were demonstrated in the famous StarCraft singleplayer campaign, which featured a greater focus on narrative and character development than the genre had previously shown. The Campaign Editor gave players access to the scripting system that built the campaign, and with it, a flexible entry gate for anyone who wanted to scratch the game development itch. From there, the integration of StarCraft into Blizzard's Battle.net online service—launched for use with 1996's Diablo—assured mapmakers a larger audience than the trove of third-party tools and web sites.[^7]() It is during this time that content creation would formally split into two separate affairs, with skirmish and custom maps being thought of as separate entities.

1998 年，暴雪娱乐发型星际争霸的同时， 发行了一款战役编辑器，带来了巨大飞跃。新的脚本技术，在著名的星际争霸中所示范的单人地图，其特点是较以往所展现的游戏类型，更注重叙事和性格发展。活动编辑器让玩家可以访问构建活动的脚本系统，并且有了它，任何想要游戏开发的人都有了一个灵活的入门。从那之后，星际争霸集成进暴雪娱乐的 Battle.net 在线服务 - 与1996年的 Diablo 保证地图制作者拥有一大批受众，相较其他第三方工具和网站更受欢迎。[^7]()正是在这期间，内容创建将正式分为两个单独的事务，小规模战斗和自定义地图被认为是独立的实体。

From this circumstance, the dota genre would make its entrance in the StarCraft custom map Aeon of Strife, as created by the mapmaker Aeon64.[^8]() The map allowed players to select a powerful character—one individual in a team of players—to compete against an onslaught of computer-controlled enemies. While Aeon of Strife was conceived in an RTS map editor, its emphasis on powerful protagonists, large waves of fodder enemies, and straight-forward level design was less like StarCraft and more like the "lawnmower"[^9]() hack-and-slash games (Dynasty Warriors, OneeChanbara, Ninety-Nine Nights) that would appear in the following decade.

从此，dota 类型将使其进入星际争霸自定义地图万世浩劫，由地图制作者 Aeon64 创建。[^8]() 地图允许玩家选择一个强大的角色 - 一个团队里独立的玩家 - 对抗计算机控制的敌人的进攻。尽管万世浩劫事在一张 RTS 地图编辑器中被构想出的，他的强大领袖的重要性、大量素材敌人以及直接的水平设计不像星际争霸，更像“割草机”\\[^ 9]()（） （Dynasty Warriors，OneeChanbara，九十九夜），在接下来的十年中出现。

As one small part of the StarCraft custom game scene, Aeon of Strife was a change of pace from the conventional game modes. StarCraft may be a classic within its genre, but like most early RTS games, it has lacked a genuine sense of scope and scale in war. As it has been described in third-party accounts, the gigantic wars on display in Aeon of Strife provided this sense of war for StarCraft players.[^10]() Because of this, it would become a regular part of the custom game scene. Countless versions and variants of the map would appear as created by various mapmakers, even as Aeon64 was nowhere to be seen.[^11]() And many of the concepts that define Defense of the Ancients would emerge in this era, including defensive control points and the sprawling, winding map layouts associated with the genre. Most crucially, some mapmakers would turn Aeon of Strife into a versus multiplayer game, with players attempting to drive their computer-controlled fodder against a competing army and their leaders.[^12]()

作为星际争霸自定义游戏场景的一个小部分，万世浩劫是从传统的游戏模式的节奏的变化。星际争霸可能是一个经典的类型，但像大多数早期 RTS 游戏，它在战争中缺乏真正的范围和规模的感觉。正如在第三方账户中所描述的那样，在万世浩劫中展出的巨大战争为星际争霸玩家提供了这种战争感。\ [^ 10]()（）正因为如此，它成为自定义游戏的常规部分。即便 Aeon64 已经不见踪影，不计其数的版本，以及这个地图的变种，被大量地图创作者创造后出现。\ [^ 11]()（）并且，许多的定义 DotA 会出现在这个时代，包括防御性的概念控制点，以及与该类型相关联的蔓延，连同这个游戏缠绕地图布局。最关键的是，一些地图制作者将万世浩劫变成一款多人游戏，同那些试图驱动其计算机控制的小兵对抗一个强竞争的军队以及他们的领导人。\ [^ 12]()（）

But even if the StarCraft custom game scene was thriving and popular, the maps remained incredibly basic. They co-opted the StarCraft art assets, game template, and user interface because they had to. The selectable characters in Aeon of Strife were simply powerful versions of the units that could already be used in the skirmish game modes.[^13]() If you were a mapmaker and you wanted to make a new character, you gave an existing unit a cool name, increased their health, upped their damage output, and that was that. Those characters were simply more powerful clones of an existing unit.[^14]() Meanwhile, total conversions of StarCraft faced the same issues as the ones built for Warcraft II.[^15]() And when compared to the content creation for other games—including Doom, Total Annihilation, Quake, and Half-Life—StarCraft custom maps were limited in both scope and quality.

但即使星际争霸的自定义游戏场景是蓬勃发展和流行，地图仍然是令人难以置信的基本。 他们选择了星际争霸艺术资产，游戏模板和用户界面，因为他们不得不。 Aeon of Strife中的可选角色只是已经在冲突游戏模式中使用的单位的强大版本。\ [^ 13]()（）如果你是一个地图制作者，你想制作一个新角色， 单位一个很酷的名字，增加他们的健康，提高他们的伤害产出，这就是。 这些角色只是一个现有单位的更强大的克隆。\ [^ 14]()（）同时，星际争霸的总转换面临与为魔兽争霸II构建的相同的问题。\ [^ 15]()（） 其他游戏的创作（包括末日，全湮灭，地震和半生命星际自定义地图）的范围和质量都受到限制。

In spite of this, StarCraft custom maps became an incredibly valuable commodity. You see, the videogame publishing model was built on the same contract as the movie industry. Basically, you use the trash to fund the good stuff. Discerning videogame players may despise the "brodude" who buys FIFA every year, but the money he spends on Electronic Arts‘ sports games can be used to finance a Mass Effect, a Dead Space, or a Titanfall. However, such a contract can even exist within a single game, where you offer a wide range of game modes for a a wide range of players. The players who enjoyed StarCraft custom maps could act as a social and economic backbone for the smaller percentage of users who pursued the game as a top-notch RTS experience. As RTS games like Warcraft II, Total Annihilation, Command and Conquer: Red Alert, and Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings were quickly left to their die-hards, StarCraft maintained incredible longevity with the help of the third-party content.[^16]() In the long run, it was worth every dime of Blizzard's attention to encourage the creation of the custom maps.

尽管如此，星际争霸的自定义地图成为一个非常有价值的商品。你看，视频游戏发布模式是建立在与电影业相同的合同。基本上，你使用垃圾资助好东西。视频游戏玩家可能会鄙视每年购买国际足联的“brodude”，但他花在电子艺术体育游戏上的钱可以用来支付质量效应，死亡空间或者泰坦尼克号。然而，这样的合同甚至可以存在于一个单一的游戏中，你为各种各样的玩家提供广泛的游戏模式。享受星际争霸自定义地图的玩家可以作为一个社会和经济的支柱，为较小比例的用户追求的游戏作为一流的RTS体验的用户。作为RTS游戏，如魔兽争霸II，总湮灭，命令与征服：红色警戒，帝国时代II：国王时代很快就留给他们的死亡，星际争霸在第三方内容的帮助下保持令人难以置信的长寿。 \ [^ 16]()（）从长远来看，暴雪的注意力值得鼓励创建自定义地图。

The wild success of StarCraft (and 2000's Diablo II) paid off handsomely for Blizzard. By the time Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos was marked for its July of 2002 release date, it was the most anticipated videogame in the history of the computer market. In spite of this, the end result was not a revolution. The game would be centered around small-scale tactics and it would share much in common with 1997's Myth: The Fallen Lords and 2000's Sacrifice. Warcraft III‘s defining concept was the powerful heroes that could level up, acquire items, and unlock powerful abilities over the course of a match. But unlike the previous Blizzard RTS games, the emphasis on base-building and fast economic management was brought to a minimum. Fans of Warcraft II and the other RTS games based on the Warcraft model had come to expect fast action and an emphasis on economic supremacy. And the focus on slower, more localized combat—with game-changing heroes at the center of the battle—would make Warcraft III one of the most polarizing games ever made.

星际争霸（和2000年的“暗黑破坏神II”）的野性成功为Blizzard慷慨解囊。当“魔兽争霸III：混乱统治”被标记为2002年7月的发布日期时，这是计算机市场历史上最受期待的视频游戏。尽管如此，最终的结果不是一场革命。游戏将围绕小规模战术，它将与1997年的神话：堕落的上帝和2000年的牺牲分享很多共同点。魔兽争霸III的定义概念是强大的英雄，可以在比赛过程中升级，获得物品，解锁强大的能力。但与以前的暴雪RTS游戏不同，强调基础建设和快速的经济管理被带到最低限度。魔兽争霸II和基于魔兽模型的其他RTS游戏已经期望快速行动和强调经济至上。而专注于较慢的，更局部的战斗 - 在战斗中心改变游戏角色的英雄 - 将使魔兽争霸III成为最极化的游戏之一。

On the other end, custom map creators fell in love with everything that the Warcraft III World Editor had to offer. They took advantage of the new maximum player limit, which bumped StarCraft‘s eight-player limit up to twelve. Since computer-controlled players are often used to fulfill essential map functions, the custom maps for Warcraft III were commonly contested on a five-on-five basis, providing the team sizes typically associated with the dota genre.[^17]() On top of this, the editor allowed native access to "Just Another Scripting Syntax", the scripting language that provides the backbone for Warcraft III maps. Players now had the power to program their game map, so long as the code functioned within the parameters outlined by Blizzard.

另一方面，自定义地图创作者爱上了魔兽争霸III世界编辑所提供的一切。 他们利用了新的最大玩家限制，这突破了星际争霸的八人限制达十二。 由于计算机控制的玩家经常用来完成基本的地图功能，所以魔兽争霸III的自定义地图通常在五对五的基础上进行竞争，提供通常与dota类型相关的团队大小。 除此之外，编辑器允许本地访问“Just Another Scripting Syntax”，这是为魔兽争霸III地图提供骨干的脚本语言。 玩家现在有权力编写他们的游戏地图，只要代码在暴雪中列出的参数内运行。

The most significant leap would come in the amount of content was now available to mapmakers. When Warcraft III was originally announced, Blizzard marketed the game under the moniker of "role-playing strategy".[^18]() And whether a narrative-driven singleplayer map or a versus multiplayer match, the player could slaughter "neutral" foes in order to gain resources (gold, items, experience) for their war effort. In the pursuit of this, Blizzard added hundreds of units and buildings that comprised every primary and secondary faction within the world of Azeroth. Where Blizzard custom map creators were once confined to the small range of units that were needed to flesh out the game's playable factions, they could now choose from an entire world of creatures and characters. All of the available unit models, down to the most pathetic slime or troll, were given as much detail and attention as a Thrall or a Jaina Proudmoore.[^19]() These creatures and buildings could be thoroughly customized for use in the new maps.

最重要的飞跃将是地图制作者现在可以获得的内容量。当魔兽争霸III最初公布时，暴雪在“角色扮演策略”的标记下销售该游戏。\ [^ 18]()（）无论是一个叙事驱动的单人地图还是多人游戏，玩家可以屠杀“中立”敌人，以获得资源（金，物品，经验）为他们的战争努力。为了追求这一点，暴雪增加了数百个单位和建筑，包括艾泽拉斯世界中的每一个主要和次要派别。当暴雪的自定义地图创作者曾经被限制在游戏中可玩的派系所需要的小范围的单位，他们现在可以选择从生物和人物的整个世界。所有可用的单位模型，到最可怕的粘液或巨魔，被给予了作为一个萨尔或吉安娜Proudmoore的细节和注意。\ [^ 19]()（）这些生物和建筑物可以彻底定制用于新地图。

With little hesitation, players imported their favorite StarCraft custom maps into the new game engine. The premise of Warcraft III would prove a perfect match for Aeon of Strife, the story of powerful badasses going to battle with a sea of mooks, and the map was quickly ported over. However, the introduction of the hero model and the lower unit counts altered the appeal of the map.[^20]() Much like the "Hero Arena" maps that dominated the early custom game scene in Warcraft III, Aeon of Strife was taking the Warcraft III hero model—a small portion of that game's construct—and turning it into its own game. Aeon of Strife was giving players a single character that could learn spells, gain items, and level up, all performed through a point-and-click user interface. Very often, these maps thrived on a novelty appeal, with heroes and characters that could grow to comical levels of strength. And if this all sounds like it has some crossover appeal with the Diablo series, that's because it absolutely does.

毫不犹豫地，玩家将他们最喜欢的星际争霸定制地图导入新的游戏引擎。魔兽争霸III的前提将证明一个完美的配合战争的永恒，强大的badasses的故事去与海洋的摩洛哥的战斗，地图迅速移植。然而，英雄模型和较低的单位计数的引入改变了地图的吸引力。\ [^ 20]()（）很像“魔法竞技场”地图占据了魔兽争霸III早期的习惯游戏场景，采取的魔兽争霸III英雄模型 - 这个游戏的构造的一小部分，并把它变成自己的游戏。 Aeon of Strife为玩家提供了一个可以学习法术，获得物品和升级的角色，所有这些都通过点击式用户界面执行。很多时候，这些地图兴起的新奇魅力，与英雄和角色，可以成长为滑稽的水平的力量。如果这一切听起来像对Diablo系列有一些交叉的吸引力，那是因为它绝对是。

However, most of these maps would remain a novelty experience because the vaunted World Editor was limited in places that it needed to be flexible. The editor allowed mapmakers to customize nearly every aspect of a unit, but in a game where units are commonly defined by their range of spells and abilities, you could not customize the individual spells and abilities that were being used by those units. They were exact copies of the ones available for use in the skirmish and campaign modes.

然而，大多数这些地图将仍然是一个新奇的体验，因为被打动的世界编辑在有限的地方，它需要灵活。 编辑器允许地图制作者定制单元的几乎每一个方面，但在一个游戏中，单位通常由其法术和能力范围定义，你不能定制那些单位正在使用的单个法术和能力。 他们是可用于小队和竞选模式的精确副本。

Third-party programs were once again created in order to overcome these limitations, and it was a battle waged with limited success. During this period, the first Warcraft III maps with custom spells and abilities would emerge, and they were prominently featured in maps like Valley of Dissent and Keys of Sealing. In the midst of this development, a player by the name Eul created something called Defense of the Ancients. The early versions of DotA were grossly limited in quality, even in regard to basics like terrain design and unit placement. However, the map featured all the trappings we associate with today's dota games: A large roster of playable characters, two bases connected by a three-lane map design, neutral monsters strewn about the map, and "hidden" merchants who sold players the most powerful items. But Battle.net content creation was a largely collaborative effort, with players borrowing and often stealing from each other. The lack of standardization for the third-party programs limited their reach and limited the progress of the dota model.

第三方计划再次被创造以克服这些限制，这是一个有限的成功的战争。在这段时间，第一个魔兽争霸3地图与自定义法术和能力将出现，他们在地图上突出特色的地图如密封和钥匙的密封。在这个发展中，一个名叫Eul的球员创造了一个名为防御的古代人。 DotA的早期版本在质量方面受到严重限制，即使是在地形设计和单元布置等基础上。然而，地图展示了我们与今天的dota游戏相关的所有诱惑：一个大型的可玩角色，两个基地通过三线地图设计连接，中性怪物散布在地图上，“隐藏”商人卖出玩家最多强大的项目。但是Battle.net内容创作是一个很大程度上协作的努力，玩家借用，经常互相窃取。第三方计划缺乏标准化，限制了它们的范围，限制了dota模式的进展。

The community would get a big surprise when the Warcraft III expansion pack The Frozen Throne arrived in July of 2003. The upgraded World Editor offered access to every aspect of the Warcraft III game model, allowing players to create their own spells and even modify the base game rules. Nearly all of the third-party programs that had been created during the Reign of Chaos days were now obsolete. With this powerful editor, players could now do anything they wanted, so long as it functioned within the Warcraft III game engine, its interface, and its scripting system. With these powerful tools now standard across the entire user base, content creators had ease of ability to create and disseminate the concepts that we now see as synonymous with Defense of the Ancients. And just like Aeon of Strife, Defense of the Ancients had become a concept and a brand, and numerous players would create their own versions of Defense of the Ancients.

当Warcraft III扩展包The Frozen Throne于2003年7月到达时，社区会得到一个巨大的惊喜。升级的世界编辑提供访问魔兽争霸III游戏模型的各个方面，允许玩家创建自己的法术，甚至修改基地 游戏规则。 几乎所有在混乱时代统治时期创建的第三方计划现在已经过时了。 有了这个强大的编辑器，玩家现在可以做任何他们想要的，只要它在魔兽争霸III游戏引擎，其界面和脚本系统中运作。 有了这些强大的工具，现在标准的整个用户群，内容创建者很容易创建和传播的概念，我们现在看到的同义词防御的古人。 就像Aeon of Strife一样，Ancients的防御已经成为一个概念和一个品牌，许多玩家将创建自己的版本的古代国防。

Early in the life of The Frozen Throne, a pair of content creators by the name of Meian and Ragn0r would create their own variant of DotA. They decided to take interesting and well-designed heroes in other versions of the map and place them under a single banner.[^21]() Much as the best professional athletes compete in All-Star games, the map would be known as DotA All-Stars. However, the pair gave up on the project shortly after its launch and left it to the dustbin. Another mapmaker by the name of Steve "Guinsoo" Feak saw potential in the map and took over the project. His chief contribution was to facilitate interaction between the human participants, distinguishing it from versions of Defense of the Ancients which emphasized the destruction of the disposable soldiers.[^22]() And through a long line of revisions, DotA All-Stars would acquire a reputation for its quality. Fans were now eager to contribute, and a team of mapmakers would work with Guinsoo in order to update the map.[^23]()

在“冻结王座”的生命早期，一对名为Meian和Ragn0r的内容创作者将创建自己的DotA变体。他们决定在地图的其他版本中采取有趣和精心设计的英雄，并将它们放在一个横幅下。\ [^ 21]()（）就像最好的职业运动员参加全明星赛，地图将被称为DotA全明星。然而，该对在发射后不久就放弃了该项目，并将其留给垃圾箱。另一个地图制作者的名字史蒂夫“Guinsoo”Feak在地图上看到潜力，并接管了该项目。他的主要贡献是促进人类参与者之间的相互作用，将它与强调破坏一次性士兵的古代人的防御版本区分开来。通过一系列的修订，DotA全明星获得其质量的声誉。球迷现在渴望贡献，一个地图制作者团队将与Guinsoo一起工作以更新地图。\ [^ 23]()（）

By 2004, serious multiplayer competition began to emerge around DotA All-Stars. To help organize the competition, Guinsoo's compatriots in Clan TDA created a system of bots that was used to enforce conduct in DotA All-Stars matches played throughout Battle.net.[^24]() TDA member Steve "Pendragon" Mescon would also create a community portal for DotA All-Stars and it would quickly grow in popularity. (At its high point, dota-allstars.com would have over a million registered users.[^25]()) By 2005, there was hardly a Warcraft III player on Battle.net who had not heard of the map, and many players did not take kindly to its existence. It was during this time that Guinsoo would hand off DotA All-Stars to fellow creators Neichus and IceFrog, a duo that possessed the programming skills necessary to continue increasing the complexity of the map.[^26]()

到2004年，在DotA全明星周围开始出现严肃的多人比赛。 为了帮助组织比赛，Guinsoo的同胞在Clan TDA创建了一个机器人系统，用于强制执行在DotA全明星比赛在Battle.net整个比赛。\ [^ 24]()（）TDA成员史蒂夫“Pendragon”Mescon也将 创建一个DotA全明星的社区门户，它会迅速增长的人气。 （在它的高点，dota-allstars.com将有超过一百万的注册用户。\ [^ 25]()（））到2005年，几乎没有一个魔兽争霸III玩家在战地网上没有听说过地图， 许多玩家没有善待它的存在。 正是在这段时间，Guinsoo会把DotA全明星交给同名的创作者Neichus和IceFrog，他们拥有必要的编程技能，继续增加地图的复杂性。

If the story had ended there, people wouldn't be writing books about the topic. But at this point, even Blizzard had taken notice of the map, and the company organized a DotA All-Stars tournament for their first BlizzCon convention in October of 2005. (Blizzard's support for the map would otherwise remain limited.) By 2006, other large tournaments were being organized and the best dota players were participating in them. DotA All-Stars had even begun to earn the ire of other custom game creators and players, because All-Stars was making it difficult for competing maps to get any exposure.[^27]() And as the Warcraft III skirmish modes were being left to their most committed players, it finally dawned that DotA All-Stars was generating more interest—and acclaim—than Warcraft III itself. DotA All-Stars was becoming ubiquitous with Warcraft III in the way that Counter-Strike would become ubiquitous with Half-Life. This version of Defense of the Ancients would become such a success that competing versions of the map would be left to history, and the lineage of maps directly leading into DotA All-Stars is now singularly identified as "Defense of the Ancients".

如果故事在那里结束，人们不会写关于这个话题的书。但在这一点上，即使暴雪也注意到了地图，该公司在2005年10月举办了第一届BlizzCon大会的DotA全明星赛。（暴雪对地图的支持仍然有限。）到2006年，其他大型锦标赛正在组织，最好的dota玩家参与其中。 DotA全明星甚至开始赢得其他自定义游戏创作者和玩家的愤怒，因为全明星使竞争地图很难获得任何曝光。\ [^ 27]()（）和作为魔兽争霸III小战模式剩下的是他们最忠实的球员，它终于曙光，DotA全明星产生更多的兴趣和声誉 - 比魔兽争霸III本身。 DotA全明星在魔兽争霸III中变得无处不在，反击将变得无处不在的半条命。这个版本的“古代防御”将成为这样一个成功，地图的竞争版本将留给历史，直接导致DotA全明星的地图沿袭现在被单独标识为“古代防御”。

The map would have a profound impact on nearly every party associated with it. In 2006, a Singapore software company would launch "GGClient"—later renamed to Garena—and the program would be used throughout Southeast Asia to play Defense of the Ancients en masse with unauthorized copies of Warcraft III.[^28]() The threat of piracy would become a major factor in Blizzard's decision to launch 2010's StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty without any formal support for offline play,[^29]() and the new version of Battle.net allowed the company to remove a map from the service if it did not meet certain criteria for ethics and copyrighted material.[^30]() [^31]() Along with a less intuitive map editor, the StarCraft II custom scene would never enjoy the popularity and success of its predecessors. Interest in the game quickly waned without a robust custom scene to act as a backbone for the die-hards.

In response to this reality, Blizzard unveiled "Blizzard DOTA" at BlizzCon in October of 2010. But at this point, Guinsoo and Pendragon had taken up residence at Riot Games. Meanwhile, IceFrog was allegedly[^32]() working with S2 Games on Heroes of Newerth and then later with Valve on Dota 2. In August of 2011, Valve would officially unveil that sequel, and both Eul and IceFrog were present on the development team. Later on, Blizzard would scuffle with Valve over the "DOTA" trademark, and Blizzard would rename their map to Blizzard All-Stars. After years of what an outsider would see as "development hell", the map is now a commercial project known as Heroes of the Storm, which has an expected 2015 release date. League of Legends and Dota 2 have become two of the most popular games in the world, dota is now the hottest genre in videogame development, the market for RTS games has come to a crawl, and Blizzard is now looking from the outside-in on the commercially-lucrative genre that was created with their own editing tools.

为了回应这一现实，暴雪在2010年10月在BlizzCon发布了“暴雪DOTA”。但在这一点上，Guinsoo和Pendragon已经在Riot Games占据了住所。与此同时，据称IceFrog与S2游戏在纽瑟的英雄，然后与阀门在Dota 2上工作。2011年8月，Valve将正式揭开续集，Eul和IceFrog都出现在开发团队。后来，暴雪将与Valve在“DOTA”商标上进行战斗，暴雪将他们的地图重命名为Blizzard All-Stars。经过多年的外人将被视为“发展地狱”，地图现在是一个商业项目被称为风暴英雄，有预期的2015发布日期。英雄联盟和Dota 2已经成为世界上最流行的游戏之一，dota现在是视频游戏开发中最热门的类型，RTS游戏的市场已经爬行，暴雪现在从外面看使用自己的编辑工具创建的商业利润丰厚的类型。

Defense of the Ancients became so popular that it would not only come to dominate the game it was created in, but have a profound impact on the companies and individuals involved in its success. And yet, for all of this success, we need to maintain some perspective. Just as the puzzle maps were an alteration of the concepts in Warcraft II, and just as the early tower defense maps were an alteration of the concepts in StarCraft, Defense of the Ancients was an alteration of the concepts in Warcraft III. The Frozen Throne‘s World Editor may have been powerful, but it was not a programming language and it was not a videogame creation tool. It was a mapmaking tool, designed to make maps with the content and game rules outlined by Blizzard. It is crucial to understand this. When players manipulated the Warcraft III game engine towards more powerful ends, problems began to show.[^33]()

古代的防御变得如此受欢迎，它不仅将控制它创造的游戏，而且对参与其成功的公司和个人产生深远的影响。 然而，对于所有这些成功，我们需要保持一些观点。 正如拼图是对“魔兽争霸II”中的概念的改变一样，就像早期的塔防图是星际争霸中的概念的改变一样，“古代防御”是魔兽争霸III中的概念的改变。 冷冻王座的世界编辑可能是强大的，但它不是一种编程语言，它不是一个视频游戏创建工具。 这是一个地图制作工具，旨在制作地图与内容和暴雪规则概述的游戏规则。 了解这一点至关重要。 当玩家操纵魔兽争霸III游戏引擎朝更强大的目的，问题开始显示。\ [^ 33]()（）

As we have already mentioned, modifications of the game and the game engine could not be disseminated on Battle.net. This meant that most custom maps used the same interface, control scheme, and game concepts in Warcraft III. Most damningly, the Warcraft III game engine does not provide native access for the "mouselook"[^34]() mechanics now synonymous with first- and third-person action games on personal computers.[^35]() But in addition, the peer-to-peer networking technology used for online play in most RTS games is designed for a game model with a large number of moving parts. Action games with fewer moving parts use a client-side prediction model to minimize the effects of networking latency, and not only could Battle.net not provide this benefit, the service (as designed for Warcraft III) uses a quarter-second hard-coded internet delay. This was intended to prevent players from gaining a substantial advantage with a better internet connection, but it discouraged the adoption of the concepts that are a mainstay in other excellent action games. And while the Warcraft III game engine has hosted concepts ranging from first-person shooters to Diablo-style action games, custom keyboard layouts (and the maps that used them) never caught on because they generate substantial input latency.[^36]()

正如我们已经提到的，游戏和游戏引擎的修改不能在Battle.net上传播。这意味着大多数自定义地图在魔兽争霸III中使用相同的界面，控制方案和游戏概念。最糟糕的是，魔兽争霸III游戏引擎不提供原生访问的“mouselook”\ [^ 34]()（）机制现在是个人电脑上的第一人称和第三人称动作游戏的同义词\ [^ 35]()此外，用于大多数RTS游戏中的在线游戏的对等网络技术被设计用于具有大量移动部件的游戏模型。具有较少移动部件的动作游戏使用客户端预测模型来最小化网络延迟的影响，并且不仅Battle.net不能提供这种优势，该服务（为Warcraft III设计）使用四分之一秒的硬编码互联网延迟。这是为了防止玩家获得巨大的优势，更好的互联网连接，但它不鼓励采用的概念，在其他优秀动作游戏的支柱。虽然魔兽争霸III游戏引擎已经托管从第一人称射击到暗黑破坏神式动作游戏的概念，自定义键盘布局（和使用它们的地图）从来没有被捕获，因为他们产生大量的输入延迟。 ）

So hopefully, you understand where I am going with this. It didn't matter which game it was: Warcraft II, StarCraft, Warcraft III. Blizzard mapmakers were influenced by incredible restrictions at every step of the way, and not the kind we typically associate with the design of videogames, where designers attempted to overcome the technical limitations presented by limited hardware. Things that were common in other genres were impossible to distribute through Battle.net and impossible to perform in the various Blizzard RTS game engines. The result is that dota is a rarity and oddball within videogames. It is one of only two genres whose rules were foremost defined by software limitations—the limitations of Blizzard game engines and their content creation tools—instead of hardware limitations.[^37]() Every time that Blizzard custom maps made their grand leap, there was simply another set of barriers that got in the way of "building the best game possible".

所以希望你明白我要这样做的地方。 它是没有关系的游戏是什么：魔兽二，星际争霸，魔兽争霸III。 暴雪地图制作者在每一步都受到令人难以置信的限制的影响，而不是我们通常与电子游戏设计相关的种类，在那里设计者试图克服有限硬件所带来的技术限制。 在其他类型中常见的事情不可能通过Battle.net分发和不可能在各种暴雪RTS游戏引擎中执行。 结果是dota在视频游戏中是一个稀罕和奇怪的。 它是仅有的两种类型之一，其规则最先由软件限制定义 - 暴雪游戏引擎及其内容创建工具的限制，而不是硬件限制。每当暴雪自定义地图做出巨大的飞跃 ，只是另一套障碍阻碍了“建设最好的游戏可能”的方式。

What this should demonstrate is that dota was not a matter of genius and great design, but of circumstance and impediment. When developers were creating the blueprints for their genres—id Software and the FPS, Capcom and the fighting game, Westwood and the RTS—those companies had minimal notion of how these genres should play and what they should look like. But more importantly, they had the freedom, creative talent, and resources to define the experience. This is not to claim that all great videogames, whether amateur or commercial, are built on a clean canvas. But the games that thrived on borrowed assets were created by one of two groups: One, the designers whose vision was not compromised by the software limitations, where amateur projects like Team Fortress were built into a game engine specifically tailored to their genre. Or two, the companies with the resources to make those borrowed assets work. For instance, taking the Unreal 3 game engine—designed for use with FPS games and long the enemy of colorful art design—and turning it into a visually-stunning platforming game like Mirror's Edge.

这应该证明，dota不是天才和伟大的设计，而是环境和障碍的问题。当开发者为他们的流派软件和FPS，Capcom和战斗游戏，Westwood和RTS创建蓝图时，这些公司对这些流派应该如何发挥以及他们应该看起来是什么样的概念。但更重要的是，他们有自由，创造性的人才和资源来定义经验。这并不是说所有伟大的电子游戏，无论是业余还是商业，都建立在一个干净的画布上。但是，借用资产兴起的游戏是由两个小组之一创建的：一个，设计师的愿景没有受到软件的限制，其中业余项目如团队要塞被内置到一个游戏引擎专门针对他们的类型。还是两个，有资源的公司使这些借用资产工作。例如，使用虚拟3游戏引擎设计用于FPS游戏和长期丰富多彩的艺术设计的敌人 - 并把它变成一个视觉上惊人的平台游戏像镜之边缘。

After spending a pathetic amount of time trying to understand videogames, there is one thing I can say with certainty: Great videogames are no fluke. You don't just fuck around in a game editor for a couple thousand hours and end up with something worth playing. As manifested today and through significant revision, the history of the dota genre is the history of amateur game designers using their limited resources to manipulate a game engine which was never designed for formal modification, never designed for traditional action games, and was demonstrably terrible at doing many of the things that were commonplace in videogames. Or, in other words, the creators of dota used an RTS game engine, the RTS concepts laid out in Warcraft III, and the Warcraft III World Editor to create a character-action game. The same game model used to create Warcraft, Age of Empires, Command and Conquer, and Total Annihilation was used to create something that shares more in common with the Diablo and Dynasty Warriors series. And in order to distribute this new genre, the creators were bound to the limitations of Battle.net distribution.

花了可观的时间，试图了解电子游戏，有一件事我可以肯定地说：伟大的电子游戏是没有fluke。你不只是在游戏编辑器里玩了几千个小时，最后还是有些值得玩的东西。正如今天和通过重大修改表明的，dota类型的历史是业余游戏设计师使用他们有限的资源来操纵游戏引擎的历史，该游戏引擎从未被设计用于正式修改，从未设计用于传统动作游戏，并且显然是可怕的做许多在电子游戏中常见的事情。或者，换句话说，dota的创造者使用RTS游戏引擎，在魔兽争霸III中设置的RTS概念，以及魔兽争霸III世界编辑创建一个角色动作游戏。用于创造魔兽，帝国时代，命令和征服和总湮灭的相同游戏模式用于创造与暗黑和帝王战士系列更相似的东西。为了分发这种新的流派，创作者受到Battle.net分发的限制。

These limitations have now defined the mechanical, aesthetic, economic, and philosophical conventions of the dota genre. Dota was an underground genre in the truest sense, operating entirely outside of commercial videogame development. The creators of Defense of the Ancients were given over half-a-decade of unopposed airtime to mold the expectations of the "hardcore dota player" and to mold their expectation of what a "great dota game" should look like. When commercial videogame companies finally decided to examine this genre, to take their resources and build a better game, they simply chose to whore the genre out. Both League of Legends and Dota 2 do little to deviate from Defense of the Ancients, and the other games which have attempted to capitalize on their popularity make the occasional step sideways instead of trying to bring the genre forward. Just as the Japanese role-playing game was largely the matter of sticking with what works when Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest made "press A to win" a commercial juggernaut, there has been little economic or critical impetus to reconsider the design of dota games.

这些限制现在定义了dota类型的机械，美学，经济和哲学约定。 Dota是真正意义上的地下类型，完全在商业视频游戏开发之外运行。古代防御的创造者被给予超过十年的无人反对的通风时间，以模仿“铁杆玩家”的期望，并模仿他们对“大dota游戏”的期望。当商业电子游戏公司终于决定检查这种类型，获取他们的资源和建立一个更好的游戏，他们只是选择了嘲笑类型。两个英雄联盟和Dota 2做一点偏离的古代人的防御，而其他游戏尝试利用他们的人气使偶尔的一步，而不是试图把类型向前。正如日本角色扮演游戏在很大程度上是坚持什么工作，当最终幻想和龙任务做出“新闻A赢得”一个商业巨头，没有经济或关键的动力重新考虑dota游戏的设计。

So, here we are. There is no question in my mind that the people who turned these custom maps into their own genre were absolutely passionate about their work. These content creators spent countless hours trying to improve their formula simply because they thought it was a goal worth pursuing. But passion is not cause for celebration in itself. Throughout the rest of this book, I will point to this circumstance whenever it is necessary to explain the lessons of the genre. In spite of the commercial and critical praise that has been extended to dota, it is my opinion that the genre can be summed up in three words: "Eh, close enough."

所以，我们在这里。 我认为，把这些自定义地图变成自己的流派的人对他们的工作充满热情。 这些内容创作者花了无数小时试图改进他们的公式，只是因为他们认为这是一个值得追求的目标。 但激情本身不是庆祝的原因。 在本书的其余部分，我将指出这种情况，每当有必要解释类型的教训。 尽管已经延伸到dota的商业和批评的赞美，我的看法，类型可以总结为三个字：“Eh，够近”。

[^1](): These games would include, but not be limited to: 1981's versus simulation game _Utopia_, 1989's shoot 'em up/RTS hybrid _Herzog Zwei_, 1989's appropriately-named city simulator _SimCity_, 1989's action-strategy hybrid _North & South_, 1989's pioneering god game _Populous_, 1990's tower defense game _Rampart_, 1990's ground-breaking turn-based strategy game _Civilization_, and 1991's side-scrolling puzzle game _Lemmings_.

[^1]（）：这些游戏包括，但不限于：1981年公司与模拟游戏\_Utopia\_，1989年的射击游戏/ RTS混合\_Herzog Zwei\_，1989年的适当命名的城市模拟器\_SimCity\_，1989年的行动策略混合\_North ＆South\_，1989的开拓神游戏\_Populous\_，1990年的塔防游戏\_Rampart\_，1990年的开创性的回合制策略游戏\_Civilization\_和1991年的侧滚动益智游戏\_Lemmings\_。

[^2](): One additional note: While 1987's _Nether Earth_ and 1988's _Herzog_ are strongly in the vein of real-time strategy, they lack the completeness of design and scope that would come to be thought of as RTS. This is the reason why later games—\_Dune II\_ and also \_Herzog Zwei\_—are typically afforded the distinction of the "first true RTS".

\ [^ 2]()（）：另外一个注释：虽然1987年的\_Nether Earth\_和1988年的\_Herzog\_是强烈的实时战略的静脉，他们缺乏设计和范围的完整性，将被认为是RTS。 这就是为什么以后的游戏 - \ _ Dune II \ \_和\ _Herzog Zwei \ \_-通常提供“第一个真正的RTS”的区别的原因。

[^3](): The significant size of the total conversions certainly limited their reach in the era of dialup. But in addition, games such as _Doom_, _Quake_, and _Total Annihilation_ were coming out of the box with significant support and flexibility for what we now consider "modmaking". The creators of those games were encouraging their player base to modify the game files, while Blizzard has spent their existence trying to keep players out of them.

\ [^ 3]()（）：总转换的显着大小肯定限制了它们在拨号时代的覆盖面。 但是除此之外，像\_Doom\_，\_Quake\_和\_Total Annihilation\_这样的游戏也开始出现，为我们现在考虑的“modmaking”提供了显着的支持和灵活性。 这些游戏的创造者鼓励他们的玩家基地修改游戏文件，而暴雪已经花了他们的存在，试图让玩家脱离他们。

[^4](): Map creators would improvise, packaging their maps with text files that would provide both the narrative backdrop and the "house rules".  Players were asked to fulfill the mission objectives outlined in the text.

\ [^ 4]()（）：地图创作者会即兴创作，使用文本文件打包他们的地图，这将提供叙事背景和“房子规则”。 玩家被要求完成文本中概述的任务目标。

[^5](): Late in the _Tides of Darkness_ Human campaign, the narrator speaks of Lord Lothar and his band of knights, who have set off to negotiate with the Orcs but have not been heard from in days. The mission launches, and the splinter of stragglers are wiped out by the overwhelming defenses of an Orcish stronghold. No scripting, no chicanery. Blizzard simply placed the soldiers inside of a functional enemy base.

[^6](): Custom maps would also be known as "UMS maps", since the "Use Maps Settings" option was necessary for maintaining the creator's predetermined unit and resource configurations. The term would become popular in the _StarCraft_ days and lose relevance in _Warcraft III_, where map files were handled differently and Use Map Settings had been entirely phased out.

\ [^ 6]()（）：自定义地图也称为“UMS地图”，因为“使用地图设置”选项是维护创建者的预定单位和资源配置所必需的。 该术语将在\_StarCraft\_天变得流行，并且在\_Warcraft III\_中失去相关性，其中地图文件被不同地处理，并且使用地图设置已经完全被淘汰。

[^7](): It's also important to mention that the original Battle.net match listing system (as used for _StarCraft_ and 1999's _Warcraft II: Battle.net Edition_) did not segregate the standard game modes from the third-party content. While players could filter the maps by the gametype, this ultimately forced skirmish and custom maps to compete in the same ecosystem and gave everyone the same relative exposure.

\ [^ 7]()（）：同样重要的是，提到原始的Battle.net匹配列表系统（用于\_StarCraft\_和1999的\_Warcraft II：Battle.net Edition\_）没有将标准游戏模式与第三方内容隔离 。 虽然玩家可以通过游戏类型过滤地图，这最终迫使小规模和自定义地图在同一个生态系统中竞争，并给予每个人相同的相对曝光。

[^8](): The origin story leaves us with a lot of holes and little public knowledge of who the map creator "Aeon64" was. I will admit that I was not there when _Aeon of Strife_ made its way into the wild. But like most of the popular _StarCraft_ and _Warcraft III_ game maps, revisions of an original version are easy enough to find if you're looking in the right places.

\ [^ 8]()（）：原产地故事给我们留下了很多漏洞，并且对于地图创建者“Aeon64”的知名度有限。 我会承认，当\_Aeon of Strife\_进入野外时，我不在那里。 但是像大多数流行的\_StarCraft\_和\_Warcraft III\_游戏地图，原始版本的修订很容易找到，如果你在正确的地方看。

[^9](): Where most brawlers put the player against no more than a dozen opponents at any time, "lawnmower" games throw as many opponents at the player as the hardware can handle. In theory, placing hundreds of foes on the screen—all doing everything they can to suffocate the player—should be a fantastic concept. In reality, these massive armies are usually punching bags, and cutting through them is a little like mowing grass. Unfortunately, series such as _Samurai Warriors_ and _Dynasty Warriors_ sell so well that there's no reason for companies to change up the formula.

\ [^ 9]()（）：在任何时候，大多数打猎者把玩家对抗不超过十几个对手，“割草机”游戏抛出与硬件可以处理的玩家一样多的对手。 在理论上，将数百敌人放在屏幕上 - 所有做他们可以扼杀玩家的一切 - 应该是一个了不起的概念。 在现实中，这些巨大的军队通常是冲压袋，切割它们有点像割草。 不幸的是，系列如\_Samurai Warriors\_和\_Dynasty Warriors\_卖得那么好，公司没有理由改变公式。

[^11](): When we refer to "_Aeon of Strife_" or another Battle.net custom map as a single entity, it's usually done out of convenience. Like most custom content on Battle.net, _Aeon of Strife_ was a brand. If your goal was to market and disseminate your map, the easiest way to do this was to associate yourself with one of those brands.

\ [^ 11]()（）：当我们将“\_Aeon of Strife\_”或另一个Battle.net自定义地图称为单个实体时，通常是为了方便。 像Battle.net上的大多数自定义内容一样，\_Aeon of Strife\_是一个品牌。 如果你的目标是推销和传播你的地图，最简单的方法是把自己与这些品牌之一。

[^13](): While a popular Machinima retrospective shows a picture of an "_Aeon of Strife_" map that features both a leveling and spell system, it is actually from "_Star Craft Dota_", a 2008 custom map bizarrely intended to port the _Defense of the Ancients_ experience back into _StarCraft_. I have seen no evidence that either system was in use during \_StarCraft\_‘s formative years.

\ [^ 14]()（）：令人惊讶的是，在这个特定的方面，Campaign Editor是War2xEd的回归，它至少允许创作者修改单位的攻击类型。

[^15](): It is also likely that Battle.net discouraged many players from building total conversions, because the service that generated most of the attention and acclaim for third-party content could not be used to disseminate them.

\ [^ 15]()（）：Battle.net很可能不鼓励许多玩家建立总转化，因为对第三方内容产生最大的关注和赞誉的服务不能用于传播它们。

[^17](): Some of the maps based on _Aeon of Strife_ featured three or four teams going at it. (The most notable map to adopt the feature was _Rival Nations_, which had more in common with the spirit and strengths of _Warcraft III_ than _Aeon of Strife_.) The precedent was later placed in a commercial format through _Dead Island: Epidemic_.

[^20](): Even if the _Warcraft III_ custom maps could feature more moving parts than a skirmish match, the game was still an early 3D RTS game. This made it difficult for map creators to get hundreds of units on the screen and still deliver an experience that was playable on the home computers of the time. The ramifications will be given attention later in the book.

\ [^ 28]()（）：Garena类似于其他服务，如Kali，Kahn和GameRanger，并使用他们的本地网络功能将游戏连接到互联网。 因为这个，程序违反没有法律。 在2006年和2007年，Garena上的_Warcraft III_玩家的总数 - 绝大多数玩家\ _Defense of Ancients \ _-将达到超过25万用户，大约是\ _Warcraft III \ _玩家数量的5倍 战斗网。

[^29](): The wild financial success of _World of Warcraft_ no doubt played into the decision to wall off _StarCraft II_. But much like Activision's choice to disable dedicated server functionality in _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2_, Blizzard was walling off a game that gained no benefit from being walled off. Quite simply, it was a business decision and an intellectual property grab. For more reading on the topic, I'll recommend my own short series on "The Creation of Battle.net 2.0".

\ [^ 29]()（）：魔兽世界的野生财政成功毫无疑问地打了决定，以摧毁_StarCraft II_。 但是很像Activision的选择，在_Call of Duty：Modern Warfare 2_中禁用专用服务器功能，Blizzard正在围堵一个没有从围墙中获益的游戏。 简单来说，这是一个商业决策和知识产权。 有关这个主题的更多阅读，我会推荐我自己的短篇系列“Battle.net 2.0的创作”。 （[source]()（http://www.learntocounter.com/the-creation-of-battle-net-2-0-part-one/））

[^30](): While this sort of enforcement may seem self-obvious to many younger videogame players, it was a deathknell for the world where third-party content, ethics, and copyright were a bit like the Wild West. And in the case of _StarCraft II_, it was only possible with a new version of Battle.net that the player base despised.

\ [^ 30]()（）：虽然这种执法对许多年轻的电子游戏玩家似乎是显而易见的，但是对于第三方内容，伦理和版权有点像狂野西部的世界来说，这是一个死亡。 而在_StarCraft II_的情况下，只有使用新版本的Battle.net才可能玩家基础鄙视。

[^31](): The belief quickly circulated that the system was meant to give Blizzard a stranglehold on the next _Defense of the Ancients_, whatever form it may appear in.

\ [^ 31]()（）：信念迅速传播，该系统的意图是给暴雪在下一个_坚固的Ancients_，任何形式，它可能出现的枷锁。

[^32](): The nature of IceFrog's employment at S2 Games is heavily disputed, and generally speaking, there's a ton of drama surrounding the early days of the genre's transition to a commercial venture. But those are issues that can be left to another writer for another day, and they are not pertinent to this book. "Allegedly" is simply to state "allegedly".

\ [^ 32]()（）：在S2 Games的IceFrog的工作的性质是严重的争议，一般来说，有很多戏剧周围的类型的过渡到一个商业企业的早期。 但这些问题可以留给另一个作家另一天，他们不相关的这本书。 “据称”只是说“据称”。

[^33](): Blizzard has been a very successful game developer, but their RTS games are often the bearers of sloppy programming, and the eye test is backed by documentation. Former Blizzard programmer Patrick Wyatt has gone on the record that the _Warcraft III_ game engine was called "brainfuck" by many of the programmers. ([source]()(http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/starcraft-orcs-in-space-go-down-in-flames))

\ [^ 33]()（）：暴雪一直是一个非常成功的游戏开发商，但他们的RTS游戏通常是马虎的编程的支持者，眼睛测试由文档支持。 前暴雪程序员Patrick Wyatt已经记录了_Warcraft III_游戏引擎被许多程序员称为“brainfuck”。 （[source]()（http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/starcraft-orcs-in-space-go-down-in-flames））

[^34](): Quite simply, "mouselook" is where the player orients the camera by moving the mouse. It's most notably used in the first-person shooter genre, where movement of the camera doubles as the means by which you aim your weapon.

\ [^ 34]()（）：很简单，“mouselook”是玩家通过移动鼠标来定位相机的地方。 它最引人注目的使用在第一人称射击类型，其中相机的运动作为你的目标你的武器的手段。

[^35](): Mouselook has been hacked into the game by enterprising players, but like most sweeping changes, it cannot be used on Battle.net. ([source]()(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5t9NWViPrE))

\ [^ 35]()（）：Mouselook已被黑客入游戏的进取的玩家，但像大多数扫荡的变化，它不能在战网上使用。 （[来源]()（http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5t9NWViPrE））

[^36](): If you wish to confirm this, load up your copy of _The Frozen Throne_ and try out the first-party custom map _Azeroth Grand Prix_. Even when it's being played in a local setting, the map has considerable issues with latency.

\ [^ 36]()（）：如果你想确认这一点，请加载你的_The Frozen Throne_的副本，并尝试第一方自定义地图_Azeroth Grand Prix_。 即使当它在本地设置中播放时，地图也有相当多的延迟问题。

[^37](): The other genre, unsurprisingly, is the tower defense genre, the world of _Plants vs. Zombies_, _Orcs Must Die!_, and _Sanctum_. In spite of 1990's excellent _Rampart_, the genre as we know it today was also codified with Blizzard's editing tools.

\ [^ 37]()（）：另一种类型，不出意料，是塔防类型，_Plants vs. Zombies_，_Orcs Must Die！_和_Sanctum_的世界。 尽管1990年的优秀_Rampart_，我们今天知道的类型也编纂了暴雪的编辑工具。
