## Why Dota Sucks Chinese Translation
This is a simplified Chinese translation of book [Why Dota Sucks](http://www.learntocounter.com/why-dota-sucks-prologue/) written in English by Michael Lowell. The translation is written in Markdown-HTML with focus on word and just for specific people who know Chinese, so I will use chinese in the repo from now on. One more thing, I created a public board [Translation Plan](https://trello.com/b/sy5ManfW/why-dota-sucks-translation-plan) on Trello, you can check it out and see how we collaborate.
